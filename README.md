# Random Password Generator: password-generator

## Description

The purpose of this challenge was to improve my coding skills specifically with JavaScript, but also some HTML and CSS. The goal was to add to existing code to get the random password generator to function properly and provide a good user experience.

This random password generator has the main purpose to create more secure passwords for users. There is multiple criteria options to cater to the user's preference including length and character options.

### Requirements

List of requirements derrived from the acceptance criteria and my personal expectations:

- User presented with multiple prompts to personalize a random password based on certain criteria.
  - Prompts include: length, uppercase characters, lowercase characters, numbers, and special characters.
- Generator requiring user to select at least one character type.
- Generated password displayed on webpage with user's selected criteria.
